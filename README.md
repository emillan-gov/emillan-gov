🌍 #About Me

Hello! I'm a Geospatial Analyst based in British Columbia, Canada, where I have the privilege of working in the public service to leverage geospatial technologies for the improvement of our community and the environment. I am fueled by a passion for creative solutions to difficult questions.

#📊 What I Do

I specialize in designing and implementing data collection tools, including surveys and field collection apps, as well as creating insightful Web Mapping solutions and Dashboards. My expertise extends to developing ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes and I have a keen interest in automating processes to enhance efficiency and accuracy in our projects.

🌿 Collaboration and Conservation

One aspect of my work that I find particularly fulfilling is the opportunity to contribute to environmental conservation efforts. I have had the opportunity to support the Marbled Murrelet, Spotted Owl and Northern Goshawk Recovery Strategy. Collaborating with Indigenous partners has been an enriching experience, allowing me to appreciate and incorporate traditional knowledge and perspectives into our projects.
